## Javascript and Node.js

- Javascript is a synchronous, blocking and single threaded language
- which cannot be used to write fast and scalable apps
- So browser and nodejs have some built in api functionality to let the code run asynchronously, not waiting for the code to complete, and instead register a callback with the function, thus the main thread is not blocked
